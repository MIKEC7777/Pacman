# Pacmen 
## challeneged with converting a single html file with css and Java script included to work as three seperate files(html,css.JS)
### I don't have much planning on future developoment but would like to experiment around with some of the variables. This exercise focusses on impementing the dom to create images that move on the click of a button as well as edge detection.
